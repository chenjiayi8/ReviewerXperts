# ReviewerXperts
 ReviewerXperts is a Python-based repository that uses the Elsevier API and GPT-3 to generate high-quality reviews on a given topic. The code queries the Elsevier API to obtain a list of relevant articles with names, abstracts, and keywords. It then uses GPT-3 to rank the articles based on their relevance, and queries the full text of the best-ranked articles using the Elsevier API. Finally, the code generates a review paper by synthesizing information from the full text of the best-ranked articles.  This repository is designed for researchers, academics, or anyone who needs to generate a high-quality review on a given topic quickly and efficiently. It contains customizable Python code, as well as instructions for using the Elsevier API and GPT-3.  ReviewerXperts is continuously updated and maintained by a team of experts who ensure that the code is up-to-date and functional. It is licensed under the MIT license, which means it can be used freely for both commercial and non-commercial purposes.
